## 🌳 Inspiration

A couple of years ago together with my friends, I took part in a programming competition. The
objective was to build a mobile app that solves a global problem. We didn't win, but the app we
built quickly spread in our families.

## 🥕 Features

## 🐻‍❄️ Installation and First Launch

1. Download the **latest stable** application binary (.apk file) from
   [Releases](https://github.com/bartek537/forest/releases).
2. Tap on the downloaded file and temporarily **allow installation from unknown sources**,
   if prompted (turn it back off after installation).
3. On some devices you may encounter a Play Protect warning, but don't worry — the app is safe
   to use and open-sourced. I'm just an unverified developer.
4. Click “Install” and wait for the app to install.
5. You are now good to go 🚀.
